Mushrooms
I worked on a Shitake mushroom farm in high school. I’ve been fasinated by organisms like forests of clone trees and
underground fungal colonies. The new Star Trek series has latched onto the idea that a fungus might somehow have
spread into a subspace (technobable) dimension. That idea drives some fun plot points, but it also revived my interest
in fungus as a storytelling device.
The last zombie novel I read and enjoyed was The Girl With All the Gifts. It has the same idea at it’s core as The Genius
Plague, which I’m currently reading. The idea of a fungus controlling the mind of a more complex host isn’t new. This
article (https://www.wired.com/2013/09/absurd-creature- of-the- week-zombie- ant-fungus/) on Wired discribes the
same ant/fungus system that both of these novels reference. There was a short story (on pseudo pod I believe) that
riffed on this concept.
The fourth Marla Mason novel includes a Mushroom God that provides a magical take on this concept. Finch by Jeff
Vandermeer involves sentient mushrooms. The recent Agents of Dreamland by Caitlín R. Kiernan involves mushrooms.
I’m also reading the Fungi anthology edited by VanderMeer and Silvia Moreno-Garcia. Earlier this year I read 10%
human, which was popular science about our gut biome.
All of this screams to be thought about together. As a metaphor it wants to say something about the small simple ideas
that infect us and drive complex behavior. It wants to say something about The Other. It reminds me to order
mushrooms on my pizza and/or trackdown the food truck that makes the amazing portabella cheese “steak.”
I’ll keep reading.
