I read WAY more comics this year than I have since I binged on Sandman
and tried for a year or so to find other things that lived up to Gaiman's
masterpiece.

I read almost all of it digital and the vast majority was what was available
by Marvel via kindle unlimited. This was probably the best use I've made of that
service.

If I go back and review any of this most reviews will probably involve multiple
volumes. With such a backlog of great things to read, it's hard to justify 
starting a digital pull list, but I've made a few exceptions.
